An idea I just had right now and shouldn't be having because I have sh*tloads of work to do, but noting it down anyway so I can pick it up in the nearby future. Yay!

## design by readme FIRST

* .js script, asyncronous + tracking id <-- can it be hosted anywhere? (hint: static assets)
	* use the ga [] model first to push pending events
* backend collects data, no immediate processing
	* which db?
* dashboard shows aggregated data
	* persona login
	* ACL (tracking / permissions)

(uggh, editing online and accidentally trying to use ViM shortcuts all the time)

## what this is about?

I guess there are enough hints already. If such a thing exists already, let me know. Otherwise I will probably just build it anyway because I will nitpick all possible minor annoyances in whatever exists already and decide to build my own.
